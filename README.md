Ranking responses generated by Gemini LLM for smart assistant tasks
# Shield – Google Home Extensions: LLM Response Ranking (Gemini)

This repository documents my contributions to the **Shield – Google Home Extensions** project, where I served as a human evaluator for **Gemini LLM** outputs through **Soul AI**, powered by **Deccan AI**. The project is part of Google's initiative to enhance the natural language capabilities of its smart assistant ecosystem through human feedback.

## 🧠 Project Overview

In this project, I evaluated and ranked pairs of responses generated by the Gemini LLM based on how well each fulfilled the user’s request in the context of smart assistant tasks. The interactions covered scenarios such as reminders, weather queries, smart device instructions, conversational replies, and more.

## 🔧 Key Responsibilities

- **Pairwise Preference Ranking:** Compared two LLM-generated responses for a single user prompt and selected the more suitable response.
- **Rubric-Based Evaluation:** Applied structured rubrics to guide decision-making:
  - ✅ **Truthfulness** – factual accuracy and non-hallucinated content
  - ✅ **Clarity** – clear, concise, and natural language
  - ✅ **Instruction Following** – accurate task completion based on the prompt
  - ✅ **Writing Tone** – appropriate formality, politeness, and user friendliness
- **Justification Writing:** Provided concise explanations for each decision to help guide model training and fine-tuning.
- **Contextual Alignment:** Ensured the response matched user context, including follow-up prompts or smart home-specific use cases.
